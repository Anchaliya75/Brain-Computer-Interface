# Brain-Computer-Interface
BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a
Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is an approach to establish a novel communication channel from men to machines. The crucial idea is to directly tap the communication at its very origin: the human brain. BCI technology is used to date primarily for intentional control. This branch of BCI research aims at the (partial) restoration and rehabilitation of lost functions in paralyzed patients (KÃ¼bler et al., 2001; Wolpaw et al., 2002). The focus of the fourth BCI competition was on BCI systems that are based on the motor and sensorimotor system of the brain. In line with the past three BCI competitions, this fourth BCI competition strives to help the field of BCI prosper by eliciting solutions for hard data analysis problems appearing in current BCI research.

Apart from communication and control, recently more and more alternative applications of BCI technology are being explored (Blankertz et al., 2010). These include enhancement of human performance (Haufe et al., 2011) and assessing subconscious perception (Porbadnigk et al., 2010, 2011). Data from those recent developments have not yet been included in the BCI competitions, but may pose interesting and novel challenges for future competitions.
